## How to Approach the Project Files:

 - `forest-fire-classification.ipynb` is the main jupyter notebook code file.
 - [Data Zip File](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rRg4zqD5vJm8hwLCUvlRtPIdRhLULTjj), you can access the `data.zip` file which have all the images for classification. I uploaded in google drive due to its huge size 384mb because the github don't allow to upload more than 25mb of file.
 - You can directly see the printed code version in html & pdf version; `final-printed-code.html` gives you more interactive display so you don't need to run jupyter notebook in your IDE to see the outputs.
